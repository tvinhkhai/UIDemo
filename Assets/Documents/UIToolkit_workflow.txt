This descrisbing how I am using UIToolkit for my future self.
Documents: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIToolkits.html

UIToolkit files:
- Stylesheets (USS based on CSS)
- UI Documents (UXML based on XML), store hierarchy and layouts
- C# code: data + event behaviours

1. Add image resources
2. Window -> UI Toolkit -> UI Builder
This is a WYSIWYG editor for UI data.
From top to bottom, left to right:
- StyleSheets: stylesheet, as my current understanding -> define a template for reusing the style on other UI element
- Hierarchy: a tree of what is in the screen
- Library: basic UI element for drag and drop to Viewport
- Viewport: dynamic size for testing, hit Preview to test UI
- Inspector: changing properties of UI element
3. In UI Builder save the current hierarchy
4. Back to Unity editor, Hierarchy, right click -> UI Toolkit -> UI Document
Drag the file saved from step 3 into Resource Asset of UI Document in step 4
Note: I named both InventoryPopup for my demo
